SQL Movie-Rating Modification Exercises

You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some data modifications. Here's the schema: 

Movie ( mID, title, year, director )
English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director.

Reviewer ( rID, name )
English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name.

Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate )
English: The reviewer rID gave the movie mID a number of stars rating (1-5) on a certain ratingDate. 

Your modifications will run over a small data set conforming to the schema.


Question 1
Add the reviewer Roger Ebert to your database, with an rID of 209.

insert into reviewer
values (209, 'Roger Ebert')


Question 2
Insert 5-star ratings by James Cameron for all movies in the database. Leave the review date as NULL.

insert into rating  ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate )
select rev.rID , m.mID, 5, null from movie m
left outer join reviewer rev
where rev.name='James Cameron'


Question 3
For all movies that have an average rating of 4 stars or higher, add 25 to the release year. (Update the existing tuples; don't insert new tuples.)

update movie set year=year+25 where mID in
(select distinct mID from rating group by mID having avg(stars)>=4)


Question 4
Remove all ratings where the movie's year is before 1970 or after 2000, and the rating is fewer than 4 stars.

delete from rating 
where stars<4 and mID in 
(select m.mID from movie m where year<1970 or year>2000)
